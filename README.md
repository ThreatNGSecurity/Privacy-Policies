# Description
The privacy policy is often disregarded and not read as it contains heavy legal language and is overly complex. 
<br>
Still, it is a great starting point for understanding what data an organization gathers, how they use it, and how they share and protect it. 
<br>This repository contains the links to each listed organization's privacy policy.
